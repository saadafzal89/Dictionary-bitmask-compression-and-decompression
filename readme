This project is designed to achieve code/data compression and decompression of binary bits and attain best compression ratio
using dictionary and bitmask based compression techniques. The dictionary consists of 16 most freqeunt entries but can be modified
to have 'n' dictionary entries. The compression has been performed based on the following formats:

1. Run length encoding (upto 8 repeating words)
2. Bitmask compression (upto 4 consecutive bits)
3. 1-bit mismatch
4. 2-bit consecutive mismatch
5. 4-bit consecutive mismatch
6. 2-bit mismatch anywhere
7. Direct matching with the dictionary entry

The format of the above mentioned techniques has been defined in the file named "compression formats".
The compressed output file is named "cout.txt" whereas the decompressed result is written to file named "dout.txt"
2 test cases were run and compression ratio of 0.32-0.40 was achieved.
